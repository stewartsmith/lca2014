Past, Present, and future of MySQL and variants


Stewart Smith
Percona
# Hi!
# I work for
-- [white] [percona-logo.jpg]
# Director of Software Architecture
# which is a MySQL support, consulting and development company
# prior to Percona, I worked for
--
Rackspace
# on Drizzle (database forked from MySQL)
# and prior to that
-- [white] [sun.png]
# on MySQL Cluster and Drizzle
# and prior to that
--
MySQL AB
# on MySQL Cluster
--
Ghosts of MySQL past
--
1979 - UNIREG
# text UI to ISAM
--
1986 - UNIREG on UNIX
# unix 80x24 interface to ISAM store
# that 80x24 text UI is still created and stored in FRM files to this day
# but no generic query language
--
mSQL
# small SQL server, source there but not FOSS
# originally plugged ISAM engine into mSQL
# wasn't right fit, so....
--
1995 - MySQL 1.0

MySQL AB founded
# First, let's go back in time...
# as well as anyone can remember, 1.0 was internal in 1995
--
1996 - 3.19
--
2000 - GPL
# Wasn't always GPL, but big step in adoption
# big risk for the company
# not big, risk all your revenue
--
Dual license: libmysql
# business and revenue model
--
May 2000 - Replication in 3.23.15
# Commonly cited 2 weeks of development
# logs all SQL statements, slave replays them.
# "binlog" - glorified log of all DML
# because without concurrency, this actually kinda works.
# Easy to set up/use. Thus it won.
# fast forward
--
Sept 2010 - PostgreSQL catches up
# postgresql 9.0 had queryable read-only slaves
# if you want to know why MySQL was so much bigger
# this is why.
# the age of a decent whisky ahead of PostgreSQL in
# usable replication.
# back to 2001:
--
2001 - 3.23 GA
# 3.23 forever. revision 4 in bzr tree is 3.23.22-beta
# GA - General Availability, "production ready"
# what MySQL says is, not what users say.
--
2001 - InnoDB storage engine
# from Finnish company Innobase Oy
# brought transactions, MVCC
--
2001 - MÃ¥rten Mickos elected CEO
--
2001 - first round VC
# Interesting implications for company
--
2002 - MySQL sued Progress NuSphere
# Why? Copyright violation
# first test of GPL in court.
# GEMINI table type. eventually GPLed and abandoned
--
2003 - second round VC
# Heavy investment in technology
# Unlikely MySQL AB could ever
# have hired as many devs otherwise.
--
March 2003: 4.0 GA
# 4.1 and 5.0 were in alpha
# three current trees
--
2003 - SAP partnership
# "Run SAP R/3 on MySQL"
# pushes things in a very odd direction
# SAP R/3 install SQL script creates tens of thousands of tables
# and a few GB of data.
# Before you do anything. MySQL did not like this in 2003.
# Why? Well... then you could use SAP without buying Oracle Database.
--
A million features for Enterprise
# This could be considered "MySQL focuses on Enterprise"
# This is 2003: before views, stored procs, triggers,
# curors, prepared statements, precision math,
# alter table performance (still not there),
# SQL access to logs, deadlock info,
# slash in table names, performance statistics, unicode,
# EXPLAIN for insert/update/delete (still not there),
# PARTITIONING, row level binary logging, fractional seconds in temporal types
--
MaxDB
# do not name your products after your kids.
# started 1977. 6 companies, 9 names.
# not MVCC.
#
# This was a DBMS that made it's way to MySQL AB from SAP
# included pascal to C compiler, incomprehensible code
# some bright spark thought this could be "integrated" with
# MySQL. No engineer ever tried.
#
# It ended up back at SAP in 2007. Failed 2nd RDBMS at MySQL AB.
# no longer GPL. Both outside contributors didn't exist.
--
2003 - Acquires Alzato
# Network DataBase - NDB
# what is to become MySQL Cluster
# distinct from replication
# NDB came out of Ericsson
# designed for GSM HLR databases
# Early versions: five-nines or zero nines.
# either worked for your app or exploded.
--
Oct 2004: 4.1 GA
# incidently, shortly before I joined MySQL AB.
--
2005: 5.0 instability
# 5.0 dev version plagued by instability
# hard for teams (such as SAP team) to work on deliverables
# when the server would continue to explode.
#
# this was so bad, CI was reinvented.
# feature++, stability--
# the fact that less stable dev trees existed did not bode well.
--
Acquisitions
# era of acquisitions
# There's been a few
--
Oct 2005: Oracle acquired Innobase Oy

Oct 2005: 5.0 "GA"
# makers of InnoDB
# referred to as "innodb friday"
# 5.0 GA was shit. New features simply didn't work.
# feeling that "marketing driven" rather than "market driven"
# It took us over a year to use 5.0 internally for support issues DB
--
End 2005: Maria project started
# create a transactional storage engine.
# not MariaDB, Maria. Now Aria.
# Forked MyISAM....
# because when you have a quality problem in main product,
# you should be distracted by a new project.
#
# GA expected end 2007
# Eight years later: no stable release.
--
2006: Netfrastructure acquired
# Needing a transactional MVCC database engine
# not owned by Oracle.
#
# Acquired existing tech, was to be called Falcon.
# Was not complete, or integrated. Work started.
# due to be complete "later this year"
#
# Other efforts also existed: revive Gemini,
# didn't go anywhere.
#
# Falcon really showed how warty the "pluggable storage engine interface"
# was. Jim: "is it really like this?" me: "yes, yes it is".
#
# NDB took arguably 2-4 years to be really stable. Falcon any different?
--
2006: PBXT
# Third party transactional engine
# sort-of log based
# very promising performance.
# Lasted until ~2011
# Hard to be a profitable SE vendor
# There are some surviving very specialized ones.
--
2006: MySQL Cluster: the first fork
# 5.0 took a long time, 5.1 wasn't any time soon
# Cluster customers needed a stable release.
# No sign of 5.1 sever ever being ready.
#
# This fork still exists.
# Many features went here first.
--
2007:

Windows Task Force
--
2007:

WTF
# best team name ever.
# somebody noticed that majority of downloads were for Windows.
# our Windows story sucked. not using native Win32 calls,
# much slower and non-Windows like than you'd expect.
--
Nov 2007: MySQL 6.0 Alpha
# Alpha being key word.
# 5.0 was finally behaving
# 5.1 was nowhere near ready
# Rumors of 6.1 tree
--
Jan 2008: Sun acquired MySQL AB
# for...
--
One Billion dollars
# Engineers did not see a lot of this.
--
2008: Year of Random Query Generator

(the destroyer of servers)
# Random Query Generator
# showed true "quality" of server
# grammar for constructing queries
# generates them, throws them at server
# 4 queries later, segfault.
# rinse, repeat.
--
June 2008: Drizzle
# Brian, followed by myself and others
# forked MySQL 6.0 and started doing what we wanted.
# turning it back into a small, understandable,
# fast database designed for the modern web.
#
# Skunkworks: announced at OSCON, not internally.
#
# Sun saw this as valuable, we went working on it full time.
# If you haven't forked the project secretly, I heartily recommend it
--
Nov 2008: 5.1 GA
# Over 3 years since 5.0 GA.
# I would have won a $20 bet if it was 6 weeks later.
#
# Why OpenStack dev process and CI is the way it is
# is a direct descendant of MySQL failings (via Drizzle)
--
End 2008: OurDelta
# MySQL was bad enough getting its own code in,
# it had neglected any process to get outside patches
# OurDelta was a patchset. Lasted bit longer than 1 year
--
End 2008: Percona Server
# Percona was founded by two former MySQLers
# end 2008, they started own branch.
--
Feb 2009: MontyW leaves Sun.
--
March 2009: Final 6.0 Alpha
# 2 years of alphas
# 4 months after 5.1 GA
# Shot it in the head.
--
2009: New MySQL dev model
# early/mid
# Don't merge rubbish.
# test-before-merge (not after)
# a bunch of mirroring of what we did in Drizzle
# Influenced by some of the grown-ups at Sun.
# every milestone is releasable
# almost desperate attempt to ever have a release
# InnoDB needed a kick
# Optimizer features all didn't work (RQG)
# 6.1-fk server side fkeys
--
Oct 2009: First MariaDB 5.1 Beta release

Monty Program AB
# Hacker business model
# Monty Program AB
# several developers left to join Monty.
--
Jan 2010: Oracle acquired Sun
# This, of course, meant that Falcon ("shipping in late 2006")
# was going to be canned, as Oracle already owned InnoBase Oy.
# Why was Falcon not there? Mgmt focus on feature&perf parity
# over reliability. The switch was ultimately too late, and
# may have been quite interesting if Sun didn't suck at running
# a profitable company.
#
# having your partner tell you at 5am you've just been acquired
# by oracle is "not funny" even if it is true.
--
Feb 2010: First MariaDB 5.1 GA
--
Nov 2010: MariaDB 5.2 GA
--
Dec 2010: MySQL 5.5 GA
--
Feb 2012: MariaDB 5.3 GA
# not based on MySQL 5.5
# By this time MariaDB was a big delta
# Several branches at once
# merging to new MySQL releases getting harder.
--
Apr 2012: First MariaDB 5.5 GA
# 16 months after MySQL 5.5 GA
--
No acquisition in 2012
--
Feb 2013: 5.6 GA
# Just 2y 2m after 5.5
--
April 2013: SkySQL acquires Monty Program
# Yet another corp backed MySQL
--
Present day
# three major vendors
--
MySQL 5.6
# current stable release.
# Oracle
--
MariaDB 5.5
# current stable release
# SkySQL
--
Percona Server 5.6
# current stable release
# Percona
--
An open source community?
# talked about more in MySQL world than you'd expect.
# Is there a development community?
--
MySQL 5.7 DR
# dev release
# 125 people have commits
# at least 125 ppl at Oracle working on
# current MySQL dev release.
# non-oracle commits hard to come by
--
MariaDB 10.0
# ~17ppl
--
MariaDB 5.5 Developer community

2-3 people
# evidence for 2-3 from 5.5.23-5.5.31
# all worked for SkySQL or merged from Oracle.
# Big bits of work are Storage Engines
# but these were all merged a long time ago
# not seeing ongoing development
--
MySQL 5.5 Developer community

1-2 people
# so Oracle is as good as MariaDB here.
--
MariaDB 10.0

3 external contributors
# on 10.0.3
# now in Beta.
# this starts to deviate even more from MySQL
# an external dev community seems largely a myth
--
Security
# Oracle company policy sucks
# security throuh obscurity is dumb.
# Maria scores better here,
# Percona largely follows Oracle releases
# and (where suitable) MariaDB patches
--
Is MySQL dying?
--
Is Oracle a good custodian?
-- [mysql-size2014.png]
# 4.1 jump was MySQL Cluster
# MySQL 5.6 most new code ever.
# to say Oracle isn't writing code is false.
-- [engine-size.png]
# MyISAM is dead, HEAP is static
# InnoDB is worked on
# InnoDB 5.7 is refactoring
# InnoDB has received more attention now that MySQL&InnoDB in same company
# than it ever has
-- [engine-size-ndb.png]
# NDB is very productive. No impact of acquisition
# mostly "new module to do X"
-- [mysql-maria-loc.png]
# MySQL closing the gap
# integrating more features
-- [maria-delta.png]
# all done using sloccount (minus inno, tokuDB)
# so this is extra, not modified code
# MariaDB 5.5 took a long time.
# MariaDB 10.0 is taking a long time
# No idea when anything from MySQL 5.7 will hit Maria.
-- [mysql-test.png]
# first GA, most current
# lines of test
# mostly SQL statements
# grown from very, very humble beginnings
# We can *see* the quality push in 5.1
-- [size-vs-tset.png]
# very clear boost *AFTER* 5.0 GA.
# 5.1 had huge jump in tests
# 5.5 stayed relatively static
# 5.6 and 5.7 have grown with code size.
# this does *not* show randgen and others
-- [maria-test.png]
# slightly larger.
# to be expected. 5.x had more features/engines than MySQL
# With 5.6 (maria 10.x) gap is closing
--
Future
--
MySQL 5.7

Feb 2015
# I'd almost lay money on it.
# Many inefficiencies and flaws in Oracle
# They can get releases out that largely work.
# That work better than any previous MySQL GA release.
--
MariaDB 10.0

Early-mid 2014
# Make-or-break for Maria
# Now it's a company back project
# company with VC.
# Features in 5.6 and 10.0 implemented differently
--
MySQL <-> MariaDB
# Migrating back and forth increasingly difficult
