# Hi!
# I worked for

-- [duration=6.944191]
MySQL AB
# on MySQL Cluster, 2004

-- [sun.png] [duration=4.079818]
# on MySQL Cluster and Drizzle
# and prior to that


-- [duration=3.363800]
Rackspace
# on Drizzle (database forked from MySQL)
# and prior to that

Ghosts of MySQL past

-- [duration=13.289173]
1979 - UNIREG
# text UI to ISAM

-- [duration=14.204985]
1986 - UNIREG on UNIX
# unix 80x24 interface to ISAM store
# that 80x24 text UI is still created and stored in FRM files to this day
# but no generic query language

-- [duration=20.283136]
mSQL
# small SQL server, source there but not FOSS
# originally plugged ISAM engine into mSQL
# wasn't right fit, so....

-- [duration=10.990934]
1995 - MySQL 1.0

MySQL AB founded
# First, let's go back in time...
# as well as anyone can remember, 1.0 was internal in 1995

-- [duration=10]
1996 - 3.19
2000 - GPL
# Wasn't always GPL, but big step in adoption
# big risk for the company
# not big, risk all your revenue

-- [duration=16.036606]
Dual license: libmysql
# business and revenue model
# incredibly significant %age of revenue

-- [duration=30.475519]
May 2000 - Replication in 3.23.15
# Commonly cited 2 weeks of development
# logs all SQL statements, slave replays them.
# "binlog" - glorified log of all DML
# because without concurrency, this actually kinda works.
# Easy to set up/use. Thus it won.
# fast forward

-- [duration=4.412672]
Sept 2010 - PostgreSQL catches up
# postgresql 9.0 had queryable read-only slaves
# if you want to know why MySQL was so much bigger
# this is why.
# the age of a decent whisky ahead of PostgreSQL in
# usable replication.
# back to 2001:

-- [duration=26.961575]
2001 - 3.23 GA
# 3.23 forever. revision 4 in bzr tree is 3.23.22-beta
# GA - General Availability, "production ready"
# what MySQL says is, not what users say.

-- [duration=13.838140]
2001 - InnoDB storage engine
# from Finnish company Innobase Oy
# brought transactions, MVCC

-- [duration=6.627558]
2001 - MÃ¥rten Mickos elected CEO
2001 - first round VC
# Marten saw company through to acquisition
# Interesting implications for company

-- [duration=17.536228]
2002 - MySQL sued Progress NuSphere
# Why? Copyright violation
# first test of GPL in court.
# GEMINI table type. eventually GPLed and abandoned

-- [duration=13.222579]
2003 - second round VC
# Heavy investment in technology
# dev team got large

-- [duration=28.476242]
March 2003: 4.0 GA
# 4.1 and 5.0 were in alpha
# three current trees

-- [duration=47.760872]
2003 - SAP partnership
# "Run SAP R/3 on MySQL"
# pushes things in a very odd direction
# SAP R/3 install SQL script creates tens of thousands of tables
# and a few GB of data.
# Before you do anything. MySQL did not like this in 2003.
# Why? Well... then you could use SAP without buying Oracle Database.

-- [duration=29.676802]
A million features for Enterprise
# SAP being "enterprise"
# different from all current users (often large scale web)
# This could be considered "MySQL focuses on Enterprise"
# This is 2003: before views, stored procs, triggers,
# curors, prepared statements, precision math,
# alter table performance (still not there),
# SQL access to logs, deadlock info,
# slash in table names, performance statistics, unicode,
# EXPLAIN for insert/update/delete (still not there),
# PARTITIONING, row level binary logging, fractional seconds in temporal types

-- [duration=58.716999]
MaxDB
# formerly Addabas D
# do not name your products after your kids.
# started 1977. 6 companies, 9 names.
# not MVCC.
#
# This was a DBMS that made it's way to MySQL AB from SAP
# included pascal to C compiler, incomprehensible code
# some bright spark thought this could be "integrated" with
# MySQL. No engineer ever tried.
#
# It ended up back at SAP in 2007. Failed 2nd RDBMS at MySQL AB.
# no longer GPL. Both outside contributors didn't exist.

-- [duration=40.649849]
2003 - Acquires Alzato
# Network DataBase - NDB
# what is to become MySQL Cluster
# distinct from replication
# NDB came out of Ericsson
# designed for GSM HLR databases
# Early versions: five-nines or zero nines.
# either worked for your app or exploded.

-- [duration=19.367393]
Oct 2004: 4.1 GA
# incidently, shortly before I joined MySQL AB.
# by this time, MySQL AB had hired just about all outside contributors
# not coping well with outside devs has a long history in MySQL.

-- [duration=46.644871]
2005: 5.0 instability
# 5.0 dev version plagued by instability
# hard for teams (such as SAP team) to work on deliverables
# when the server would continue to explode.
#
# this was so bad, CI was reinvented.
# feature++, stability--
# the fact that less stable dev trees existed did not bode well.

-- [duration=9.591952]
Acquisitions
# era of acquisitions
# There's been a few

-- [duration=54.521732]
Oct 2005: Oracle acquired Innobase Oy

Oct 2005: 5.0 "GA"
# makers of InnoDB
# referred to as "innodb friday"
# 5.0 GA was shit. New features simply didn't work.
# feeling that "marketing driven" rather than "market driven"
# It took us over a year to use 5.0 internally for support issues DB

-- [duration=39.051086]
End 2005: Maria project started
# create a transactional storage engine.
# not MariaDB, Maria. Now Aria.
# Forked MyISAM....
# because when you have a quality problem in main product,
# you should be distracted by a new project.
#
# GA expected end 2007
# Eight years later: no stable release.

-- [duration=74.205887]
2006: Netfrastructure acquired
# Needing a transactional MVCC database engine
# not owned by Oracle.
#
# Jim Starkey, Ann harrison
#
--
Falcon
# Acquired existing tech, was to be called Falcon.
# Was not complete, or integrated. Work started.
# due to be complete "later this year"
#
# Other efforts also existed: revive Gemini,
# didn't go anywhere.
--
Pluggable storage engine architecture

Warts and all
# Brilliant marketing, primitive teche.
#
# Falcon really showed how warty the "pluggable storage engine interface"
# was. Jim: "is it really like this?" me: "yes, yes it is".
#
# NDB took arguably 2-4 years to be really stable. Falcon any different?

-- [duration=37.635159]
2006: PBXT
# Third party transactional engine
# sort-of log based
# very promising performance.
# Lasted until ~2011
# Hard to be a profitable SE vendor
# There are some surviving very specialized ones.
# InnoDB is just really damn good.

-- [duration=37.119713]
2006: MySQL Cluster: the first fork
# 5.0 took a long time, 5.1 wasn't any time soon
# Cluster customers needed a stable release.
# No sign of 5.1 sever ever being ready.
#
# This fork still exists.
# Many features went here first.
# row based rpl, circular rpl with conflict resolution
# online DDL (add/drop index and column)
# Got releases out, got minor releases out

-- [duration=5.878443]
2007:

Windows Task Force

-- [duration=30.808052]
2007:

WTF
# best team name ever.
# somebody noticed that majority of downloads were for Windows.
# our Windows story sucked. not using native Win32 calls,
# much slower and non-Windows like than you'd expect.

-- [duration=47.127399]
Nov 2007: MySQL 6.0 Alpha
# Alpha being key word.
# 5.0 was finally behaving
# 5.1 was nowhere near ready
# Rumors of 6.1 tree

-- [duration=4.130266]
Jan 2008: Sun acquired MySQL AB
# for...

-- [duration=24.446249]
One BILLION dollars
# Engineers did not see a lot of this.

-- [duration=50.292187]
2008: Year of Random Query Generator

(the destroyer of projects)
# Random Query Generator
# showed true "quality" of server
# grammar for constructing queries
# generates them, throws them at server
# 4 queries later, segfault.
# rinse, repeat.
# Heavy dents in Optimizer in 6.0, falcon, every "scalable" mysql solution

-- [duration=39.251389]
June 2008: Drizzle
# Brian, followed by myself and others
# forked MySQL 6.0 and started doing what we wanted.
# turning it back into a small, understandable,
# fast database designed for the modern web.
#
# Skunkworks: announced at OSCON, not internally.
#
# Sun saw this as valuable, we went working on it full time.
# If you haven't forked the project secretly, I heartily recommend it

-- [duration=36.886204]
Nov 2008: 5.1 GA
# Over 3 years since 5.0 GA.
# I would have won a $20 bet if it was 6 weeks later.
#
# Why OpenStack dev process and CI is the way it is
# is a direct descendant of MySQL failings (via Drizzle)

-- [duration=22.664297]
End 2008: OurDelta
# MySQL was bad enough getting its own code in,
# it had neglected any process to get outside patches
# OurDelta was a patchset. Lasted bit longer than 1 year

-- [duration=37.451717]
End 2008: Percona Server
# Percona was founded by two former MySQLers
# end 2008, they started own branch.

-- [duration=5.928780]
Feb 2009: MontyW leaves Sun.

-- [duration=31.241230]
March 2009: Final 6.0 Alpha
# 2 years of alphas
# 4 months after 5.1 GA
# Shot it in the head.

-- [duration=31.157454]
2009: New MySQL dev model
# early/mid
# Don't merge rubbish.
# test-before-merge (not after)
# a bunch of mirroring of what we did in Drizzle
# Influenced by some of the grown-ups at Sun.
# every milestone is releasable
# almost desperate attempt to ever have a release
# InnoDB needed a kick
# Optimizer features all didn't work (RQG)
# 6.1-fk server side fkeys

-- [duration=31.674126]
Oct 2009: First MariaDB 5.1 Beta release

Monty Program AB
# Hacker business model
# Monty Program AB
# several developers left to join Monty.

-- [duration=59.617409]
Jan 2010: Oracle acquired Sun
# This, of course, meant that Falcon ("shipping in late 2006")
# was going to be canned, as Oracle already owned InnoBase Oy.
# Why was Falcon not there? Mgmt focus on feature&perf parity
# over reliability. The switch was ultimately too late, and
# may have been quite interesting if Sun didn't suck at running
# a profitable company.
#
# having your partner tell you at 5am you've just been acquired
# by oracle is "not funny" even if it is true.

-- [duration=4.695835]

-- [duration=36.819805]
MySQL 5.7 DR
# dev release
# 125 people have commits
# at least 125 ppl at Oracle working on

-- [duration=36.403015]
MariaDB 10.0
# ~17ppl

-- [duration=41.516109]
MariaDB 5.5 Developer community

2-3 people
# evidence for 2-3 from 5.5.23-5.5.31
# all worked for SkySQL or merged from Oracle.
# Big bits of work are Storage Engines
# but these were all merged a long time ago
# not seeing ongoing development

-- [duration=21.082329]
MySQL 5.5 Developer community

1-2 people
# so Oracle is as good as MariaDB here.

-- [duration=32.889919]
MariaDB 10.0

3 external contributors
# on 10.0.3
# now in Beta.
# this starts to deviate even more from MySQL
# an external dev community seems largely a myth

-- [duration=38.984402]
Security
# Oracle company policy sucks
# security throuh obscurity is dumb.
# Maria scores better here,
# Percona largely follows Oracle releases

Is Oracle a good custodian?

-- [mysql-size2014.png] [duration=84.080444]

# 4.1 jump was MySQL Cluster
# MySQL 5.6 most new code ever.
# to say Oracle isn't writing code is false.
# core linux kernel size: ~1.1million lines
# core MySQL 5.6 size (sans plugins) ~800kloc

-- [maria-delta.png] [duration=37.885605]

# all done using sloccount (minus inno, tokuDB)

# MariaDB 5.5 took a long time.
# MariaDB 10.0 is taking a long time
# No idea when anything from MySQL 5.7 will hit Maria.

-- [mysql-test.png] [duration=73.489517]

# very clear boost *AFTER* 5.0 GA.
# 5.1 had huge jump in tests
# 5.5 stayed relatively static

# this does *not* show randgen and others

-- [maria-test.png] [duration=71.907288]

Future

-- [duration=44.130573]
MySQL 5.7

Feb 2015
# Oracle doesn't talk, I do.
# I'd almost lay money on it.
# Many inefficiencies and flaws in Oracle
# They can get releases out that largely work.
# That work better than any previous MySQL GA release.

-- [duration=28.759628]
Percona Server
# continue to be following Oracle

MariaDB 10.0

Q1 2014
# Make-or-break for Maria
# delta may be smaller.. but
# differences in core components.
# hard to tell what's new to Maria 10, vs MySQL. going to get harder.
# Now it's a company backed project
# company with VC.
# Features in 5.6/5.7 and 10.0 implemented differently
# parallel replication, multi-source rpl

--
MySQL <-> MariaDB
# Migrating back and forth increasingly difficult
# replication differences are likely to be problematic
